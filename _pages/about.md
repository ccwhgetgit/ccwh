Hi! I’m currently a graduate student in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago. I recently graduated from the National University of Singapore with a double honors in Business Administration and Computing (IS). My Honors Thesis, "Beyond Borders- Exploring Maximal Extractable Value (“MEV”) and Risks in Cross-Domain CEX-DEX Arbitrage" was advised by Professor Ben Charoenwong and Dr Nicholas Garcia. My interests include fitness, travelling, and reading non-fiction. <br> <br>
